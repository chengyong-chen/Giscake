*Coming soon* .........


**Giscake** is a open source, light weight and easy to use web map library written in javascript ES6. Using it you can publish map and GIS data on your website. It is created by Chengyong Chen, a chinese living in Canada.

My goal is to create the best web map platform:

 - less comments, the code should be best comments for itself; 
    
 - less events between components, making it esier to understand the logics; 
    
 - if I can write something in one line I won't use two(except for some *if else* statement, I like one *if* for one condition). 

The mian difference between this library and the others, like Leaflet, Giscake mainly focuses on handling **vector data, big data and styling**. Giscake can load single page vector map, which is relatively size small, when a map is very big, it can be pieced into small vector or image tiles. Giscake handles vector data through pbf(Protocol buffer Binary) format, which make the data size much smaller, being loaded faster.

Giscake is not just a basemap platform, it has lots of GIS features, you can also create different types of themetic map series, display and load information associated with geometries dynamically.

There is a desktop application called **Diwatu Mapper**, which is a free GIS and map designing software, written in c++ by myself. Using Diwatu Mapper you can designe a map, and export to Giscake. You can import almost any format of maps into Diwatu Mapper, export to Giscake after finishing your design.

Giscake can also be used for displaying any graphical files, i.e. you can import a *pdf* file into Diwatu Mapper and export to Giscake.



If you go to www.diwatu.com, you will find thounds of maps which you can use as a base map and do some customization. Most of the source map files are downloadable, you can redesign it in Mapper basing on what you want.

Diwatu Mapper can be downloaded from here www.diwatu.com

I am actively maitaining Diwatu Mapper and Giscake, if you find any bugs and new feature request, please log a bug or create request in here. Or you can contact me through my email, chengyong.chen@hotmail.com


Giscake is the leading open-source JavaScript library for **mobile-friendly interactive maps**.
