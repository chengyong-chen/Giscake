*Coming soon*


**Giscake** is a web map library written in javascript ES6, it was created by Chengyong Chen, a chinese living in Canada.

My goal of this project is to make the code as **simple** as I can:

 - less comments, the code should be best comments for itself; 
    
 - less events between components, making it esier to understand the logics; 
    
 - if I can write something in one line I won't use two(except for some *if else* statement, I like one *if* for one condition). 

The mian difference between this library and the others, like Leaflet, Giscake mainly focuses on handling **vector data, big data and styling**. Giscake can load single page vector map, which is relatively size small, when a map is very big, usually it is loaded through either vector tiles or image tiles. Giscake handles vector data through pbf file, which make the data size much smaller, being loaded faster.

There is a desktop application called **Diwatu Mapper**, which is a GIS and map designing software, written in c++ by myself. Using Diwatu Mapper you can designe a map, and export it to the format which you load into Giscake. You can import almost any format of maps into Diwatu Mapper, export to Giscake after finishing your design.

Giscake can also be used for displaying any graphical files, i.e. you can import a *pdf* file into Diwatu Mapper and export to Giscake.

If you go to www.diwatu.com, you will find thounds of maps which you can use as a base map and do some customization. Most of the source map files are downloadable, you can redesign it in Mapper basing on what you want.

Diwatu Mapper can be downloaded from here www.diwatu.com

I am actively maitaining Diwatu Mapper and Giscake, if you find any bugs and new feature request, please log a bug or create request in here. Or you can contact me through my email, chengyong.chen@hotmail.com


Giscake is the leading open-source JavaScript library for **mobile-friendly interactive maps**.
