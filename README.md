# Giscake
**Giscake** is an open source, light weight and easy to use web map library written in javascript ES6. Using it you can publish map and GIS data on your website. It is created by Chengyong Chen, a chinese living in Canada.

My goal is to create the best web map platform:

 - less comments, the code should be best comments for itself; 
    
 - less events between components, making it esier to understand the logics; 
    
 - if I can write something in one line I won't use two(except for some *if else* statement, I like one *if* for one condition). 

The mian difference between this library and the others, like Leaflet, Giscake mainly focuses on handling **vector data, big data and styling**. Giscake can load single page vector map, which is relatively size small, when a map is very big, it can be pieced into small vector or image tiles. Giscake handles vector data through pbf(Protocol buffer Binary) format, which make the data size much smaller, being loaded faster.

Giscake is not just a basemap platform, it has lots of GIS features, you can also create different types of themetic map series, display and load information associated with geometries dynamically. Giscake can also be used for displaying any graphical files, i.e. you can import a *pdf* file into Diwatu Mapper and export to Giscake.

**What Giscake really looks like**:	

- Pupular web maps, like Google, OpenLayer, Bing and any all others

- Vector map as one page	

- Tiled vector map

- Tiled image map

- A vector map on top of a 3rd part web map

- Any pdf graphic file

- Thematic map 

- A thematic map with dynamic timeline 

- Thematic map on top of a 3rd part web map 
 

# Diwatu Mapper
Diwatu Mapper is a desktop application, which is a free GIS and map designing software, written in c++ by myself. Using Diwatu Mapper you can designe a map, and export to Giscake. You can import almost any format of maps into Diwatu Mapper, export to Giscake after finishing your design. Diwatu Mapper can be downloaded from here www.diwatu.com

# www.diwatu.com
https://www.diwatu.com is a basemap sharing platform. If you go to https://www.diwatu.com, you will find thounds of maps which you can use as a base map and do some customization. Most of the source map files are downloadable, you can redesign it in Mapper basing on what you want.

Diwatu.com also a website which helps non-developer users to created thematic maps. It is created by myself as well.
